# UntitledPartyGame
No title, will be a collection on smaller games I want to package into a larger game


## If you are interested in an exe file (or mac equivalent)
You can create one yourself with this file (although it won't always be a stable version) or email me -- emrickgj ( a t ) m i a m i o h . e d u

-- Eventually once I have a few games a game flow that is playable I will start using the releases tab to push these exe's in a playable state. I also want to create a server browser using a droplet, but that is far in the future.
